A. Dimension Tables
Dimension tables contain descriptive attributes related to the facts and are typically used for filtering, grouping, and labeling in queries.

*Customer Dimension Table

Purpose: Contains details about the customers.
Table Definition:

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE e_commerce_db.dimensions.customer_dimension (
    customer_id STRING PRIMARY KEY, -- Unique identifier for each customer
    customer_name STRING, -- Name of the customer
    country STRING, -- Country where the customer resides
    email STRING, -- Customer's email address
    phone STRING, -- Customer's phone number
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -- Timestamp when the customer record was created
)
COMMENT = 'Dimension table containing customer information'; -- Comment for the table


*Product Dimension Table
Purpose: Contains details about the products being sold.
Table Definition:
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE e_commerce_db.dimensions.product_dimension (
    stock_code STRING PRIMARY KEY, -- Unique code for the product
    description STRING, -- Description of the product
    category STRING, -- Product category
    unit_price FLOAT, -- Price per unit
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -- Timestamp when the product record was created
)
COMMENT = 'Dimension table containing product information'; -- Comment for the table


*Time Dimension Table
Purpose: Contains various time attributes for analyzing trends over time.
Table Definition:
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE e_commerce_db.dimensions.time_dimension (
    time_id STRING PRIMARY KEY, -- Unique identifier for the time
    date DATE, -- Date
    month INT, -- Month
    quarter INT, -- Quarter
    year INT, -- Year
    day_of_week STRING, -- Day of the week
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -- Timestamp when the time record was created
)
COMMENT = 'Dimension table containing time attributes'; -- Comment for the table


Fact Table
Fact tables contain quantitative data (metrics) that are often analyzed and aggregated. They typically include foreign keys referencing dimension tables.

Sales Fact Table
Purpose: Contains sales transaction data.
Table Definition:
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE e_commerce_db.facts.sales_fact (
    invoice_no STRING, -- Invoice number
    stock_code STRING, -- Stock code from product dimension
    customer_id STRING, -- Customer ID from customer dimension
    time_id STRING, -- Time ID from time dimension
    quantity INT, -- Quantity sold
    unit_price FLOAT, -- Price per unit
    total_amount FLOAT, -- Total amount (calculated as quantity * unit_price)
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, -- Timestamp when the record was created
    PRIMARY KEY (invoice_no, stock_code, customer_id, time_id), -- Composite primary key
    FOREIGN KEY (stock_code) REFERENCES e_commerce_db.dimensions.product_dimension(stock_code), -- Reference to product dimension
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES e_commerce_db.dimensions.customer_dimension(customer_id), -- Reference to customer dimension
    FOREIGN KEY (time_id) REFERENCES e_commerce_db.dimensions.time_dimension(time_id) -- Reference to time dimension
)
COMMENT = 'Fact table containing sales transaction data'; -- Comment for the table


Summary of Relationships
Customer Dimension: Linked to the sales fact table through customer_id.
Product Dimension: Linked to the sales fact table through stock_code.
Time Dimension: Linked to the sales fact table through time_id.

ETL Process

Extract:
Load data from CSV files (invoices) into raw tables.

Transform:
Clean and normalize the data, create surrogate keys for dimensions.
Aggregate sales data as needed.

Load:
Load transformed data into dimension tables (customers, products, time).
Load transactional data into the sales fact table.
