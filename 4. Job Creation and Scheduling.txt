A. ETL Job Design & Development
Objective: Build ETL jobs to load and transform data into Snowflake from source systems (Oracle, CSV files, APIs, etc.).
Steps:

Define ETL Workflows:
Use Informatica, IICS, or DataStage to design ETL workflows.
Define the data flow: extraction from source, transformation logic, and loading into Snowflake.
Include the following tasks in workflows:
Data extraction from Oracle (or any other sources) and staging in Snowflake.
Data transformation (e.g., cleansing, aggregations, joining, filtering).
Data loading into production tables in Snowflake.
Apply error handling and logging mechanisms to each workflow.

Develop ETL Jobs:
Develop individual jobs for different data pipelines:
Job 1: Extract and load customer data.
Job 2: Extract and load product data.
Job 3: Extract and load sales transactions.
Each job is modular and handles specific data domains, ensuring modularity and scalability.

Error Handling and Auditing:
Implement error-checking mechanisms and notifications for failures (e.g., send email alerts).
Capture auditing logs for data processing (e.g., number of rows processed, timestamp, error logs).


B. Job Testing and Validation
Objective: Ensure that ETL jobs function as expected and load accurate data.
Steps:

Unit Testing:
Test each job for individual datasets (e.g., customer, product, and sales) using smaller data sets.
Validate the results of transformations (e.g., ensure correct aggregations, filtering).

End-to-End Testing:
Run all jobs together to test the full pipeline from extraction to loading in production.
Ensure data integrity at every step and confirm it matches business requirements.
Validate the performance of the jobs under load (e.g., with larger datasets).

Performance Tuning:
Optimize job runtimes by tuning SQL queries, transformations, and loading strategies.
Adjust resource allocation (e.g., parallelism settings) in Informatica, IICS, or DataStage to speed up execution.

3. Job Scheduling
Objective: Automate the execution of ETL jobs at scheduled intervals based on business needs.
Steps:

Define Job Scheduling Requirements:
Identify data refresh frequency (e.g., daily, hourly, weekly).
Determine job dependencies (e.g., the customer job must run before the sales job).

Job Scheduling Tool Selection:
Use Autosys or Control-M for scheduling and monitoring ETL jobs.
Create job dependencies and chain jobs in the correct sequence.

Job Setup in Autosys/Control-M:
Create job definitions for each ETL job in the scheduler.
Define the job frequency, such as daily runs at midnight for daily data loads.
Define job dependencies and failure recovery (e.g., if a job fails, trigger a notification or rerun the job after X minutes).

Trigger Mechanism:
For real-time loads, set up event-based triggers (e.g., file arrival or database change).
For batch jobs, configure time-based scheduling (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly).

4. Monitoring and Notifications
Objective: Ensure continuous monitoring and receive alerts for failures or performance issues.
Steps:

Job Monitoring Setup:
In Autosys or Control-M, configure monitoring to track the status of each ETL job.
Enable real-time dashboards for job execution status, errors, and performance bottlenecks.

Alert and Notification Setup:
Configure email alerts or SMS notifications for job failures, delays, or exceptions.
Set up thresholds for warnings (e.g., if job execution time exceeds X minutes).

Audit Logs:
Maintain detailed logs of job execution, including start time, end time, data volumes, and any errors encountered.
Store logs in a centralized logging system for historical analysis and troubleshooting.

5. Job Deployment
Objective: Deploy ETL jobs to production for regular execution.
Steps:
Promotion from Development to Production:
After thorough testing in a staging environment, promote ETL jobs to the production environment.
Version Control:
Use version control (e.g., Git, SVN) to track changes in job logic or transformations.
Maintain proper documentation and versioning to allow rollback in case of issues.

6. Post-Deployment Validation
Objective: Validate job execution in production and ensure data is processed correctly.
Steps:

First Run Validation:
Run the jobs in the production environment for the first time and validate that the data is correctly loaded.
Cross-verify loaded data in Snowflake with source data to ensure accuracy.

Performance Monitoring:
Monitor the performance of the jobs in production. Adjust job settings (e.g., parallelism, resource allocation) if necessary to optimize runtime.

Conclusion
This phase focuses on designing, developing, testing, and deploying ETL jobs and ensuring they are scheduled and monitored effectively. The ETL jobs extract, transform, and load data into Snowflake, while job scheduling tools like Autosys or Control-M automate their execution and provide real-time monitoring capabilities. With proper error handling, performance tuning, and notifications, this phase ensures the data pipeline operates efficiently in a production environment.
