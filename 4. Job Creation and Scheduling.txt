A. ETL Job Design & Development
Objective: Build ETL jobs to load and transform data into Snowflake from source systems (Oracle, CSV files, APIs, etc.).
Steps:

Define ETL Workflows:
Use Informatica, IICS, or DataStage to design ETL workflows.
Define the data flow: extraction from source, transformation logic, and loading into Snowflake.
Include the following tasks in workflows:
Data extraction from Oracle (or any other sources) and staging in Snowflake.
Data transformation (e.g., cleansing, aggregations, joining, filtering).
Data loading into production tables in Snowflake.
Apply error handling and logging mechanisms to each workflow.

Develop ETL Jobs:
Develop individual jobs for different data pipelines:
Job 1: Extract and load customer data.
Job 2: Extract and load product data.
Job 3: Extract and load sales transactions.
Each job is modular and handles specific data domains, ensuring modularity and scalability.

Error Handling and Auditing:
Implement error-checking mechanisms and notifications for failures (e.g., send email alerts).
Capture auditing logs for data processing (e.g., number of rows processed, timestamp, error logs).



B. Job Scheduling
Objective: Automate the execution of ETL jobs at scheduled intervals based on business needs.
Steps:

Define Job Scheduling Requirements:
Identify data refresh frequency (e.g., daily, hourly, weekly).
Determine job dependencies (e.g., the customer job must run before the sales job).

Job Scheduling Tool Selection:
Use Autosys or Control-M for scheduling and monitoring ETL jobs.
Create job dependencies and chain jobs in the correct sequence.

Job Setup in Autosys/Control-M:
Create job definitions for each ETL job in the scheduler.
Define the job frequency, such as daily runs at midnight for daily data loads.
Define job dependencies and failure recovery (e.g., if a job fails, trigger a notification or rerun the job after X minutes).

Trigger Mechanism:
For real-time loads, set up event-based triggers (e.g., file arrival or database change).
For batch jobs, configure time-based scheduling (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly).

C. Monitoring and Notifications
Objective: Ensure continuous monitoring and receive alerts for failures or performance issues.
Steps:

Job Monitoring Setup:
In Autosys or Control-M, configure monitoring to track the status of each ETL job.
Enable real-time dashboards for job execution status, errors, and performance bottlenecks.

Alert and Notification Setup:
Configure email alerts or SMS notifications for job failures, delays, or exceptions.
Set up thresholds for warnings (e.g., if job execution time exceeds X minutes).

Audit Logs:
Maintain detailed logs of job execution, including start time, end time, data volumes, and any errors encountered.
Store logs in a centralized logging system for historical analysis and troubleshooting.


Conclusion
This phase focuses on designing, developing, testing, and deploying ETL jobs and ensuring they are scheduled and monitored effectively. The ETL jobs extract, transform, and load data into Snowflake, while job scheduling tools like Autosys or Control-M automate their execution and provide real-time monitoring capabilities. With proper error handling, performance tuning, and notifications, this phase ensures the data pipeline operates efficiently in a production environment.
