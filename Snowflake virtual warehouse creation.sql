Step 1: Log in to Snowflake
Open your Snowflake web interface.
Log in with your credentials.

Step 2: Create a Virtual Warehouse
You can create a virtual warehouse using SQL commands in Snowflake. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

SQL Command to Create a Virtual Warehouse

CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE ecommerce_warehouse
WITH
    WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'SMALL'            -- Choose size: X-Small, Small, Medium, Large, X-Large
    AUTO_SUSPEND = 300                  -- Automatically suspend after 5 minutes of inactivity
    AUTO_RESUME = TRUE                   -- Automatically resume when a query is submitted
    MAX_CONCURRENCY_LEVEL = 10;         -- Set the max concurrent queries (optional)


Step 3: Configure the Virtual Warehouse
Parameters Explained
WAREHOUSE_SIZE: You can choose the size based on your expected load. Options include:
X-Small
Small
Medium
Large
X-Large
AUTO_SUSPEND: The warehouse will automatically suspend after the specified number of seconds of inactivity (e.g., 300 seconds).
AUTO_RESUME: This setting allows the warehouse to resume automatically when a new query is executed.
MAX_CONCURRENCY_LEVEL: This defines the maximum number of concurrent queries that can be executed.


Step 4: Start Using the Virtual Warehouse
Once the warehouse is created, you can set it as the active warehouse for your session. Use the following command:

USE WAREHOUSE ecommerce_warehouse;

Step 5: Verify the Virtual Warehouse
To ensure that your warehouse has been created successfully, you can run:

SHOW WAREHOUSES;
This command will display all the warehouses in your Snowflake account, including their current status (active or suspended).

Step 6: Clean Up (If Needed)
If you need to drop the warehouse at any point, you can do so with:

DROP WAREHOUSE IF EXISTS ecommerce_warehouse;


Summary
Log in to Snowflake.
Create a virtual warehouse using SQL commands.
Configure the warehouse parameters based on your needs.
Use the warehouse for executing queries.
Verify the creation of the warehouse with a query.
Clean up by dropping the warehouse if necessary.
