ETL Design Overview with Informatica

1. Source Definition
Source System:
Input File: Excel/CSV file containing invoice data with the following columns:
InvoiceNo
StockCode
Description
Quantity
InvoiceDate
UnitPrice
CustomerID
Country

2. Target Definition
Target Database:
Database Table: Invoice_Facts
InvoiceNo (VARCHAR)
StockCode (VARCHAR)
Description (VARCHAR)
Quantity (INT)
InvoiceDate (DATE)
UnitPrice (DECIMAL)
CustomerID (VARCHAR)
Country (VARCHAR)
TotalPrice (DECIMAL)


3. Transformation Logic
Transformations:
Data Type Conversion:
Convert InvoiceDate to a DATE format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
Ensure numeric fields like Quantity and UnitPrice are in the correct data types (e.g., INT and DECIMAL).

Calculated Fields:
Create a new field TotalPrice calculated as:
sql
Copy code
TotalPrice = Quantity * UnitPrice

Data Cleaning:
Remove any records with null or invalid InvoiceNo.
Validate that Quantity is greater than 0.

Deduplication:
Implement logic to handle duplicate records based on InvoiceNo and StockCode.

Data Enrichment (if applicable):
Join with another dimension table (e.g., Customer_Dimension) if you have customer-related information.

4. ETL Process Flowchart
Here’s a flowchart representing the ETL process:

5. Repository Structure
Here’s an example of how you might structure your Informatica repository for this project:

Invoice_ETL_Project
│   README.md
│
└── Mapping
    ├── Invoice_Data_Mapping.xml
    ├── Workflow_Invoicing.xml
    └── Session_Invoicing.xml

6. How to Run
To execute this ETL process, follow these steps:

Setup Source and Target:
Configure the Excel/CSV file as a source in Informatica.
Define the target database connection for Invoice_Facts.

Develop Mappings:
Create a new mapping in Informatica for transforming the invoice data.
Add the source definition and implement transformations as defined.

Create Workflows:
Set up a workflow that includes the mapping and session tasks to load the data into the target table.

Run the Workflow:
Execute the workflow in Informatica to load and transform the data.

Conclusion:
This design outlines the ETL process using Informatica PowerCenter for processing invoice data. The design includes source and target definitions, transformation logic, and a flowchart representation of the ETL process. By following this design, you can effectively extract, transform, and load invoice data into your data warehouse.
