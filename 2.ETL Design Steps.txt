A. Data Extraction

Source Systems:

Oracle (Transactional Data)
CSV Files (Product, Marketing, and Campaign Data)

Extraction Tools:
Informatica IICS for extracting data from Oracle.
File ingestion from external CSV files using IICS and Snowpipe for automatic ingestion into Snowflake.

Steps:

Define the connection between Oracle and Informatica IICS.
Create Informatica mappings to extract the required tables (e.g., Orders, Customers, Products).
Set up Snowpipe for automatic CSV file ingestion into Snowflake.

B. Data Transformation

Transformation Tools:
Informatica IICS for data cleaning, filtering, deduplication, and transformations.
SQL scripts for further manipulation within Snowflake.

Transformation Steps:

Data Cleaning:
Remove duplicates, format date columns, and normalize customer names.

Data Enrichment:
Join customer and order data to create enriched datasets (e.g., customer lifetime value, order history).

Aggregation:
Create aggregate tables (e.g., monthly sales performance, customer segmentation).

Key Transformations:

Sales KPIs: Compute key metrics like total revenue, average order value, and customer lifetime value (CLV).
Customer Segmentation: Classify customers based on purchasing behavior (e.g., repeat buyers, one-time purchasers).

C: Data Loading

Target Warehouse: Snowflake on AWS.

Loading Tools:

Informatica IICS for loading structured and transformed data into Snowflake tables.
Snowpipe for automatic and continuous data loading of external CSV files.

Steps:

Load raw and transformed data from Oracle into Snowflake staging tables using Informatica.
Define staging and production schemas in Snowflake.
Create jobs to move data from staging to the final tables in Snowflake.
