A. Understand Business Requirements
Objective: Identify key business questions the model needs to answer, such as KPIs, reports, and analytics needs.
Steps:
Engage stakeholders (business analysts, data scientists, etc.) to understand the data points required.
Identify key metrics like sales performance, customer segmentation, product performance, etc.

B. Define Data Sources
Objective: Understand and document the sources of data that need to be ingested into Snowflake.
Steps:
Identify all data sources (e.g., transactional systems like Oracle, CSV files, APIs, third-party services, etc.).
Determine the frequency of data extraction (e.g., real-time, daily, weekly).
Clarify the data types, formats, and volumes.

C. Define Data Schemas
Objective: Organize data into separate schemas to isolate different phases of data processing.
Steps:
Raw Schema:

Contains raw, unprocessed data as received from the source.
Tables: Store extracted data without any transformation. Often used for backup or auditing purposes.
Example: Customer_Raw, Sales_Raw, Product_Raw.
Staging Schema:

Holds data in an intermediate stage after applying transformations, cleansing, or enrichment.
Tables: Temporarily store cleansed or partially transformed data to be used in further transformations.
Example: Customer_Staging, Sales_Staging, Product_Staging.
Production Schema:

The final, clean, and fully transformed data used for analytics and reporting.
Tables: Contains the final data models ready for querying. Often designed to support star or snowflake schema modeling.
Example: Customer_Dimension, Sales_Fact, Product_Dimension.

D. Define Snowflake Tables and Columns
Objective: Design the structure of tables, dimensions, and facts based on the data model.
Steps:
Customer Dimension:

Contains detailed information about each customer.
Columns: CustomerID, Name, Address, Email, Age, Gender, Segment (e.g., demographic details, behavior segments).
Purpose: Enables detailed customer profiling and segmentation.
Product Dimension:

Contains the product catalog data, including product attributes.
Columns: ProductID, ProductName, Category, Price, Availability, SupplierID.
Purpose: Enables analysis of product sales, categories, and pricing.
Sales Fact Table:

Contains sales data, aggregated by daily, monthly, or other time intervals.
Columns: SaleID, CustomerID, ProductID, DateID, SalesAmount, Quantity.
Purpose: Allows analysis of sales trends, customer purchases, and product performance.

E. Apply Data Modeling Principles
Objective: Choose the right data modeling approach based on the complexity of relationships between entities.
Steps:
Star Schema:

A denormalized approach where fact tables reference multiple dimension tables directly.
Example: The Sales Fact table references Customer, Product, and Date dimension tables.
Snowflake Schema:

A normalized approach where dimensions can be further divided into sub-dimensions.
Example: The Product Dimension can be normalized into multiple tables, such as Product and Category.
Handling Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD):

SCD Type 1: Overwrite old data with new data (for non-historical data).
SCD Type 2: Maintain historical data by adding new rows for changes (for historical tracking).
6. Establish Data Relationships
Objective: Define foreign key relationships between fact and dimension tables.
Steps:
Link fact tables to dimension tables using primary and foreign keys (e.g., CustomerID, ProductID, DateID).
Ensure consistency in data relationships and the ability to drill down on data (e.g., customer-to-sales, product-to-sales).

F. Implement Partitioning and Clustering
Objective: Optimize query performance by implementing partitioning and clustering strategies.
Steps:
Partitioning: Split large tables based on date or another significant key (e.g., partitioning the Sales_Fact table by Date or Region).
Clustering: Cluster large tables based on specific dimensions (e.g., clustering Sales_Fact by CustomerID or ProductID).

G. Define Data Governance and Security
Objective: Ensure data governance and apply security measures.
Steps:
Define data access policies for different roles (e.g., read, write, or admin access for specific schemas).
Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to protect sensitive data (e.g., customer PII data).
Set up data masking for sensitive data where necessary (e.g., customer emails or credit card information).

H. Design Performance Optimization Techniques
Objective: Ensure the data model is performant and scales as data grows.
Steps:
Optimize queries by reducing joins or applying materialized views for frequent queries.
Implement caching or result set persistence in Snowflake for commonly run queries.
Regularly monitor performance and usage patterns to adjust cluster sizes.

I. Test and Validate the Data Model
Objective: Ensure the model meets business requirements and is accurate.
Steps:
Create test cases for data validation (e.g., ensuring all data is correctly loaded into dimension tables).
Perform queries to validate that the data model returns correct results based on the original requirements.
