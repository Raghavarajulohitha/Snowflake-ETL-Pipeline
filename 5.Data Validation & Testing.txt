1. Data Validation
Steps:
Source-to-Target Data Validation:
Compare the data in the source systems (e.g., Oracle, flat files) with the data loaded into the Snowflake environment.
Ensure the count of rows in the source tables matches with the target tables in Snowflake for each load.
Validate column-level transformations by comparing specific fields in the source and target, ensuring that data is transformed correctly based on business rules.

Data Integrity Checks:
Perform primary key and foreign key validations to ensure that relationships between tables (such as between Customer_Dimension and Sales_Fact) are maintained.
Check for duplicate records and ensure there are no orphan records that violate referential integrity.

Field-Level Validation:
Check that required fields are not NULL and that fields meet their data type requirements (e.g., numeric values are in the correct range, date formats are valid).
Validate data length and precision for numeric and string fields, ensuring no data is truncated or improperly formatted.

Boundary Testing:
Test the ETL pipeline with edge cases like empty data sets, large data volumes, and unusual data formats to ensure robustness.

2. Functional Testing
Steps:

Transformation Logic Testing:
Validate the ETL transformations as per business logic. For example, ensure that customer segments are being calculated correctly and that product price adjustments are accurately reflected.

Aggregation Testing:
Verify that fact tables (e.g., Sales_Fact) contain correct aggregated data (e.g., daily, monthly totals) as per business rules.
Ensure that roll-up summaries and groupings (e.g., by product category, sales region) are accurate.

Schema and Data Structure Testing:
Validate that the schemas and data structures in Snowflake (e.g., raw, staging, production schemas) are designed as per the data model.
Ensure that table structures are compliant with design requirements, including correct indices and partitions if applicable.

3. Performance Testing
Steps:

ETL Job Performance:
Test the ETL job performance in terms of execution time and resource utilization (e.g., CPU, memory).
Ensure that the ETL jobs are able to handle the expected data volume within the required time frame (meeting SLAs).

Query Performance Testing:
Test the performance of analytical queries running against the Snowflake data warehouse. This includes query optimization, indexing, and partitioning to ensure fast retrieval of data.

Load Testing:
Run load tests with large datasets to simulate peak load conditions and ensure the system is capable of scaling.

4. Data Quality Testing
Steps:

Completeness Testing:
Ensure all required data is present in the Snowflake tables. For example, if you expect daily sales data, confirm that every day is represented in the Sales_Fact table without gaps.

Accuracy Testing:
Check the accuracy of data by comparing with trusted datasets or manually calculating some values (e.g., total sales) and comparing them with the ETL output.

Consistency Testing:
Ensure that data across multiple tables is consistent. For example, customer information in the Customer_Dimension should be consistent with references in the Sales_Fact table.

Data Profiling:
Use profiling tools (e.g., Informatica Data Quality, SQL queries) to check data patterns, outliers, and unexpected data values in the Snowflake environment.

5. End-to-End Testing
Steps:

Workflow Execution Testing:
Run end-to-end tests of the entire ETL pipeline to ensure that jobs run in the correct order and produce the expected output without manual intervention.

Cross-Environment Testing:
Perform tests across different environments (development, staging, production) to validate the consistency and integrity of the pipeline in each environment.

Error Handling and Recovery Testing:
Test error handling mechanisms by intentionally introducing failures (e.g., missing files, incorrect data formats) to ensure that the system recovers gracefully and errors are logged properly.

Automation Testing:
Test the scheduling and automation of the ETL jobs using Autosys or Control-M to ensure they execute as expected at the scheduled times.

6. Test Case Documentation and Sign-Off
Steps:

Test Case Documentation:
Create detailed documentation for each test case, including input data, expected output, and actual results.
Document any issues or bugs identified during testing and their resolution status.

Stakeholder Sign-Off:
Share test results with stakeholders for approval. This includes sharing performance metrics, data validation reports, and test case outcomes.
Once stakeholders are satisfied with the testing results, obtain formal sign-off to proceed with deployment.

Outcome of Phase 5:
The ETL pipeline is validated and functioning as expected, ensuring data accuracy, performance, and quality. This allows the project to confidently move into the deployment phase.
