1. Requirements Gathering
The requirements gathering phase is crucial for understanding the project scope, data sources, and business needs.

A. Identify Stakeholders
Business Users: Understand their needs for reporting and analysis.
Data Engineers: Identify technical requirements for data extraction and loading.
Data Analysts: Gather requirements for data transformations and insights needed.
IT Security: Ensure compliance with data security and governance policies.

B. Define Business Objectives
Key Goals: What insights are needed? For example, improving sales performance, understanding customer behavior, or optimizing inventory management.
KPIs: Identify key performance indicators to measure success, such as total sales, customer retention rate, and average order value.

C. Data Source Identification
Transactional Data:
    Oracle Database: Identify tables related to sales, customers, and products.
External Data:
    CSV Files: Determine additional data sources for marketing campaigns, product catalogs, and customer feedback.
    APIs: Check for any external APIs that may provide relevant data.

D. Data Requirements
Data Volume: Estimate the size of data that will be processed.
Data Quality: Assess the quality of data in the Oracle Database and external sources. Identify potential issues such as duplicates or missing values.
Data Frequency: Determine how often data needs to be extracted and loaded (e.g., real-time, daily, weekly).

E. Transformation Requirements
Data Cleaning: Define rules for cleaning the data (e.g., removing duplicates, standardizing formats).
Data Enrichment: Identify necessary enrichments (e.g., calculating customer lifetime value, segmenting customers).
Aggregations: Specify required aggregations (e.g., total sales per month, average sales per product).

F. Reporting Requirements
Visualization Tools: Confirm that Tableau will be used for reporting and dashboarding.
Dashboard Features: Gather requirements for key features in dashboards (e.g., filters, drill-down capabilities, visual types).

G. Compliance and Security
Data Governance: Ensure alignment with data governance policies.
Security Requirements: Identify data access controls and encryption requirements for sensitive data.

H. Documentation
Requirements Document: Compile all gathered information into a formal requirements document for approval by stakeholders.
